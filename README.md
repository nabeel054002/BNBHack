# BNBHack
This is the github repo made for the smart contracts as part of the BNB Hackathon held in SJ Kunsthalle, on th 17-19th of December..
This was my first offline hackathon where my team got third place
This project is about a dapp in which you can have random nft swaps, with a soulbound functionality to track users
I was responsible for the backend, for the frontend code was written by my teammate David Lee, and the integration was done by me, but it was partially implemented
due to time constraint.
Checkthe frontend code at https://github.com/DavidLee9291/bnb-samsara
